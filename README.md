## About:
- This is a 2 player game of tic-tac-toe. The styling is set to a breakfast theme of Bacon vs. Doughnut.
- After the game loads, a display at the top of the screen will indicate if it is Bacon or Doughnut's turn. 
- When 3 icons are placed consecutively across, down, or diagonal, a message will appear indicating the player has won.
- The wins will be recorded on the respective players score board which will persist on refresh.
- The game will automatically reset itself.
- In the event of a draw, no wins will be awarded and the game will reset.
- One a token is placed, the gamespace is locked until the end of the game.

### Technologies used:
* html
* css
* JavaScript


#### Project Goals:
* write DRY JavaScript
* localStorage to persist data
* event delegation to handle similar event listeners
* Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
* Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
* Use problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

#### Future Versions:
* Ability to change which player goes first
* Functionality to save gameboard counters
* after 100 games, an easter egg appears
